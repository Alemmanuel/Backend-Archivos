# 📸📝 Image and File Analyzer with AI

Welcome to the **Image and File Analyzer with AI** project! This backend leverages the powerful APIs of Hugging Face and Deepseek to analyze images and translate text. 🚀

## Features

### 🔍 Image Analysis
This project uses the Hugging Face model to analyze images and generate detailed descriptions. The model used is **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)**, which is capable of generating accurate and detailed descriptions of images.

### 🌐 Text Translation
In addition to image analysis, this project also uses the Deepseek API to translate text from English to Spanish. This is especially useful for translating the descriptions generated by the Hugging Face model.

### 📄 PDF Analysis
The project also includes the capability to analyze PDF files, extracting and displaying the text contained within them.

## 🚀 How to Clone and Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-file-analyzer-ai.git
   cd image-file-analyzer-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
   ```properties
   # Hugging Face API Token
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token

   # Deepseek API Token
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_token

   # Server Port
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the frontend:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to interact with the frontend.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the Hugging Face and Deepseek APIs.
- **cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **pdf.js**: Library for analyzing and extracting text from PDF files.

## 📚 APIs Used

### Hugging Face
We use the Hugging Face API to analyze images and generate detailed descriptions. The model used is **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)**.

### Deepseek
We use the Deepseek API to translate text from English to Spanish. This is especially useful for translating the descriptions generated by the Hugging Face model.
